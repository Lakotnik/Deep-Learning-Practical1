# Deep-Learning
Repository associated with the course Deep Learning at the RUG.

# Brainstorming Section Down Here

## Methods to try out
- CNN
	- Try different activation functions
	- Different optimization functions
- SVM? (how to transform image into 'feature vector')
- GAN/RNN?
- Just for the memes, try out ImageNet?

## Datasets
- MNIST/EMNIST dataset
- CIFAR-10
